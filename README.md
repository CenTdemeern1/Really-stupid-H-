# Really stupid H🌎
[H🌎 (an esolang)](https://esolangs.org/wiki/H%F0%9F%8C%8D) does not accept input and is completely deterministic.<br>
In fact, the language only supports printing text and exiting the program.<br>
I hope you see where I'm going with this.<br><br>
The main idea of "Really stupid H🌎" is that by just interpreting the code, converting it to printf and return statements, and putting it into a main function in C, you can """""compile""""" H🌎.
